# Jaundice Prediction Program

## Problem Statement
Jaundice is a common medical condition indicative of underlying liver or blood disorders that requires early detection for effective treatment. Traditional diagnosis relies on clinical examination and laboratory tests, which may not always be accessible promptly. This project aims to provide a simple, user-friendly tool to predict the likelihood of jaundice based on key symptoms and lab indicators entered by the user, helping in early awareness and timely consultation.

## Scope of the Project
This program uses a machine learning model trained on synthetic patient data to classify whether a person has jaundice or not. It focuses on a limited set of medically relevant features such as bilirubin levels, yellowing of eyes and skin, presence of dark urine, fatigue, abdominal pain, and age. The scope covers a console-based interactive application suitable for educational and preliminary screening purposes but not for definitive medical diagnosis.

## Target Users
- Medical students and educators seeking to understand medical data classification with practical examples.
- Data science and machine learning learners focusing on healthcare applications.
- Healthcare professionals looking for basic demonstration tools.
- General users interested in basic symptom-based health risk assessments.

## High-Level Features
- Accepts user input for key jaundice symptoms and liver function indicators.
- Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict jaundice likelihood.
- Outputs a clear prediction along with a confidence score (risk percentage).
- Highlights the detected symptoms relevant to jaundice.
- Provides health safety advice urging users to consult medical professionals.
